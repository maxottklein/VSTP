VSTP is a virtual step sequencer and the starting point for the development of new kinds of music interfaces, that shall enable collaborative interactions within virtual reality (VR). In this respect, VSTP not only breaks down the boundaries between reality and virtuality, but also enables musicians to collaborate with each other across borders.
